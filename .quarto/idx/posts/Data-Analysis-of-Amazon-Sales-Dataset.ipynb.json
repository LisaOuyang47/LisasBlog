In the dataset, product IDs, names, categories, product descriptions, links to product photos and links to their official websites are listed; various prices (before, after, and percentages of discounts) are also available; and finally, users' ratings and reviews of the products they purchased, including their personal information (IDs and names) are also included in this dataset.\n\n### Data Source\n**Amazon Sales Dataset** came from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset). This dataset was scraped from the official Amazon website via BeautifulSoup and WebDriver in Python by KARKAVELRAJA J (owner).\n\n### Motivations \nOut of personal interest, I am personally more interested in the relationship between consumer behavior and corporate behaviors in the marketplace. This is especially true for a multinational company as large as Amazon, which has a business that spans basically the entire world. When a company of this size can operate successfully, the idea of analyzing its sales data is something that nobody can resist. And because of my passion for digital humanities, I think it is a very worthwhile thing to do sentiment analysis on Amazon's user reviews. Not only can we understand certain specific needs of users, but we can also have predictions about consumer behavior, which contributes to the company's ability to better improve on a humanistic basis, thus boosting sales and stabilizing its customer base. \n  \n### Research Questions\n(Might change based on findings)\n\nBased on the data set and my interests, I decided to focus my interest in solving the following problems:\n- **What are the most popular categories of products?**\n\n*a. What is the overall sentiment of users towards such products? What is particularly noteworthy?*\n\n- **What is the relationship between product price and user rating?**\n\n*a. Are there cases in which prices are manipulated (price increase, then price decrease) to gain sales for profit?*\n\n- **What is the overall sentiment of the user? How can we learn about e-commerce through user reviews?**\n\n\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n## Exploratory Data Visualizations\n\n# Data Analysis & Data Visualizations\n\nIn this section, I will focus on analyzing what users say about the product, analyzing the words that appear most often in the review; analyzing the overall sentiment for each product type\n\nPotential visualizations:\n- Graph of the relationship between product price and user rating of the product\n- Percentage of discounts for product categories (product category with >2 occurrences)\n- Histogram of frequency of (negative/positive) words (maybe top20)\n- Overall sentiment score ploe for different product category (interactive?)\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"Data-Analysis-of-Amazon-Sales-Dataset.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Final Project","description":"Final Project of Amazon Sales Dataset","author":"Shiqi Ouyang","date":"03/12/2023","date-modified":"03/12/2023"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
